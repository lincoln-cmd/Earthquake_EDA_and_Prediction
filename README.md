# 📌 Project Title

**Earthquake EDA & Prediction**

---

## 📁 Overview
**Introduction:**  
This project aims to overcome the limitations of conventional earthquake prediction systems that rely heavily on past statistical records. By introducing AI-based predictive models and real-time visualization dashboards, the project supports faster and more accurate earthquake risk assessment for citizens and public institutions.

**Features:**
- Time-series earthquake data exploration and preprocessing
- Machine learning-based earthquake prediction modeling
- Visualization of prediction results with risk levels
- Web dashboard and alert system

**Target Users:** General public, geoscientists, public institutions, developers
